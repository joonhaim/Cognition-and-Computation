## Assignment 1: Memory Models (Group)

**Topic:** Modeling recognition memory with **DPSD** and **UVSD**  
**Tools:** Python, ROC curves

We compared the performance of:
- **Dual-Process Signal Detection (DPSD)** model
- **Unequal Variance Signal Detection (UVSD)** model
- A **random guessing baseline**

### Highlights
- Implemented memory strength simulations.
- Generated ROC curves to assess model fit.
- Found both UVSD and DPSD outperform random guessing.

## Assignment 2: Language Segmentation (Group)

**Topic:** Word segmentation using **transitional probabilities**  
**Dataset:** Artificial language stream  
**Tools:** Python, histogram analysis

### Highlights
- Computed syllable transitions using `P(y|x)`.
- Used thresholds to identify likely word boundaries.
- Evaluated the segmentation strategy with insights from infant language learning.

## Assignment 3: Decision Making & DDM (Group)

**Topic:** Simulating the **Drift Diffusion Model (DDM)**  
**Models:** Random Walk, Thresholds, Drift Rates  
**Tools:** Python, statistical plots

### Highlights
- Simulated decision-making as evidence accumulation.
- Analyzed the effects of **threshold** and **drift** on speed and accuracy.
- Replicated key insights from Bogacz et al. and Forstmann et al.

## Assignment 4: Connectionism (Individual)

**Topic:** Implementing McClellandâ€™s **IAC Model**  
**Name:** Adrien Joon-Ha Im (3984389)  
**Focus:** Associative memory, inhibitory/excitatory dynamics

### Highlights
- Built an IAC network with node-level activation dynamics.
- Simulated property/instance retrieval with real-time decay, excitation, and inhibition.
- Compared outputs with McClelland's 1981 results.
